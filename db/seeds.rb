  summary: "Cockapoos are bred more for temperament than for appearance, and they tend to inherit the sweet, loving and friendly natures common with both parent breeds. They are highly intelligent, easy to train and also typically inherit the poodle's enthusiasm and tendency to be little jokers.

  These dogs tend to be extremely friendly and thrive on social interaction. They hate to be left alone and can develop separation anxiety if left solo for long periods. They get along well with other pets and children although, due to their high energy and enthusiasm, they tend to do better with older children and should be supervised around young children.",
